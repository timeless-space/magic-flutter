> Magic empowers developers to protect their users via an innovative, passwordless authentication flow without the UX compromises that burden traditional OAuth implementations.

## ⚠️ Device Registration Requirement  ⚠️
As of `v4.1.0`, users will be asked to go through a device registration flow to securely confirm any new device they use to login. If you run into [this issue](https://github.com/magiclabs/magic-flutter/issues/31), please consider upgrading to the latest version of the SDK.

## Get started

Install Flutter & Dart https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

## Start the project

```bash
$ cd project_root/magic_demo
$ flutter run
```

Dependency installation is automatically done in the `flutter run` command

For detail integration please check our [official doc](https://magic.link/docs/auth/api-reference/client-side-sdks/flutter)
or README in each package directory

### Blockchain access

Make sure you have the third-party blockchain dependencies installed
* Tezos via Tezart
* Solana via Crypto-please/solana

You may remove these dependencies if you don't need to access these chains

## Development Caveats

Files ending with `*.g.dart` are auto generated type files that are used to serialize / deserialize a class.
To generate a new sets of files to reflect your changes please run the command below at `your/path/to/magic_sdk`

```bash
$ dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Proguard rules 
Relates to [issue #43](https://github.com/magiclabs/magic-flutter/issues/43).

Add a `proguard-rules.pro` file under your `android/app` folder (or update your existing one), with the following rule:
```
# Preserve annotated Javascript interface methods.
-keepclassmembers class * {
    @android.webkit.JavascriptInterface <methods>;
}
```
Example: [Magic Flutter Demo App](https://github.com/magiclabs/magic-flutter/blob/main/magic_demo/android/app/proguard-rules.pro)
